# UNIX-System-Resources-Monitor

This is a UNIX environemt system resouce monitor written in C++.

It determines CPU and memory usage, both in aggregate and per-process, and reports this information to the user
at a specified interval and a chosen number of times for a given number of processes.

The project features the implementation of a priority queue class to order processes according to their activity
level as information about them is retrieved.
