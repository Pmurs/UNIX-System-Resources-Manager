Final Project Description

I'm choosing to do the system resources monitor project as recommended by the professors. I am working alone.
My project will monitor per-process CPU utilization, per-process memory utilization and overall disk utilization.
The program will take user inputs for the refresh rate and duration for which to monitor, updating the user at the specified interval.

The implementation for my project is essentially a set of calls to files in /proc and its subdirectories. It will be written in C++.

The timeline for my project is somewhat skewed by the massive compilers project I have due on the 13th. As unadvisable as I know this is, this project is mostly on the backburner until then.

I intend to have one of the three resources being monitored correctly by the middle of that week, leaving me with five or six days to implement the other two.

Wish me luck. I'm never taking 16+ hours in a semester ever again.
